<h3>MOOC</h3>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>
MOOC: I am a member of <a href="http://www.edu-infinity.org/">Edu-Infinity Translation Group</a> (教育无边界字幕组 in Chinese), the first and largest Chinese subtitle groups for online courses. I am one of the team leaders for computer science courses, and I also participated to many other topics such as maths, history, human rights, psychology, social science, and so forth. I mainly translate from English and French into Chinese. Our main collaborators are Coursera and edX. Below is a list of courses I have translated as a member or team leader and some awards I've been given.
