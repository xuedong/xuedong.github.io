An online learning workshop was held at Telecom Paritech on September 20, followed by the PhD defense of <a href="https://www.cvernade.com/" style="color:#3A01DF">Claire Vernade</a>. <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/" style="color:#3A01DF">Csaba Szepesvári</a> gave a talk on adaptive convex optimisation, and <a href="http://wouterkoolen.info/" style="color:#3A01DF">Wouter Koolen</a> gave a talk on learning rates in online learning.

As my first official "business" travel during my PhD life, this event truly means something to me. It represents the start of a mesmerizing, hopefully at least, journey. Thank you Claire for the nice <i>pot de thèse</i> ^^.
