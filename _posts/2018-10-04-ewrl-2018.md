The 14th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2018) was held in Lille from October 1st to October 3rd. Organized by our lovely SequeL team, EWRL 2018 has received 190+ registrations, 70 submissions (44 accepted) from all over the world (NOT ONLY EUROPE!!!).

Reinforcement learning is becoming one of the hottest research topics in the machine learning community recently (cf. submission trends for ICML and NIPS). RL deals with the sequential decision making problem in unknown (and often) stochastic and/or partially observable environments. This time the event was composed of an exciting program with 3 tutorials: (1) Advanced Topics in Exploration by <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/" style="color:#3A01DF">Csaba Szepesvári</a> and <a href="http://tor-lattimore.com/" style="color:#3A01DF">Tor Lattimore</a> from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), (2) Deep Reinforcement Learning by <a href="https://hadovanhasselt.com/" style="color:#3A01DF">Hado van Hasselt</a> from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), and (3) Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning by <a href="https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea" style="color:#3A01DF">Andreas Krause</a> and <a href="https://berkenkamp.me/" style="color:#3A01DF">Felix Berkenkamp</a> from [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/de.html), combined with 10 invited talks. Detailed program can be downloaded [here](https://ewrl.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ewrl2018_booklet.pdf).

I presented a poster on continuum-armed bandits. Photos and videos of the workshop will be available soon.
