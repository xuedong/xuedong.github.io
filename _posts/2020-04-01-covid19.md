With the actual pandemic of COVID-19, it is hardly for anyone to keep her/himself out of the loop. The machine learning community is now making its effort to help our medical and biological fellow beat the virus. Some aspects to which our community can contribute include outbreak prediction, epidemiological modelling, drug discovery, viral genome sequencing, health care management, etc. These are the topics covered by the workshop on COVID-19 hosted by the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/en). The workshop was made virtual of course, and it was also a first-time experience for me and for many of my fellows in the domain. Fairly speaking the logistic of the whole workshop worked quite smoothly with only a few connection issues.
