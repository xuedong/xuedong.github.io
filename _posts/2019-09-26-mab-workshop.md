It was unexpectedly (this is maybe not the correct word to use, beyond my expectation might be more appropriate?) successful of the <a href="https://grunewalder.blog/workshop-on-multi-armed-bandits-2019/">multi-armed bandit workshop</a> mainly organized by <a href="https://grunewalder.blog/" style="color:#3A01DF">Steffen Grünewälder</a>. It is rather rare (to the best of my knowledge, it is unprecedented) to have a pure workshop dedicated to such a small sub-field like ours. The workshop has gathered, I would say, almost half of the known researchers in the domain, mostly based on Europe, but some of whom even come from north America. The two-day workshop is composed of several invited talks and one poster session each day.

It was a great pleasure for me to meet a bunch of brilliant young new comers on the topic, but also to re-unite with some old SequeL (my team) friends. It is simultaneously surprising and unsurprising to see that almost 1/3 of the present attendees have or had some links to SequeL. There are two papers that seem to interest me a lot: “Non-Asymptotic Pure Exploration by Solving Games” by Rémy Degenne, Wouter M. Koolen and Pierre Ménard, and “Best Arm Identification in Spectral Bandits” by Tomáš Kocák and Aurélien Garivier <s>(it should be Best-Arm instead of Best Arm in the title)</s>. I am recently starting to work on pure exploration for linear bandits, which should be highly correlated to the mentioned two papers. In particular, it would be interesting to investigate the game-theoretical point of view in the BAI for linear bandits case.
