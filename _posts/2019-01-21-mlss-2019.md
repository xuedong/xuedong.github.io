I attended the highly-reputed, and probably the most popular [Machine Learning Summer School](http://mlss.cc/) from Jan 5th until Jan 20th, for its first time being held in the great continent of Africa. While being under-represented in the machine learning community in this AI era, this MLSS in Stellenbosch, South Africa was part of the events to strengthen African machine learning. It was a great honor for me to be accepted to this remarkable cornerstone event.
