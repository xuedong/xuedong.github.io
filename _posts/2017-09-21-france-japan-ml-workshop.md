The first France-Japan Machine Learning Workshop was held on September 21-22 at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (special thanks should be dedicated to Marco Cuturi). This is the first workshop that gathers leading researchers from both countries working in machine learning and affiliated fields such as statistics, applied maths and optimization.
