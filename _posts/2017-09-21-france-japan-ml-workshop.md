Hi there, here is my very first event blog, just a few days before I start my PhD life (for which I am waiting almost unpatiently but also with a lot of anxious). From now on, I will be continually writing about different (in particular scientific and technological) events during this exciting coming journey. Scientific events like international conferences will play a crucial role in the early career of a young researcher. I hope, with these diary-like blog posts, to record some unforgettable parts of my life (<s>and to improve my English writing lol</s>.

The France-Japan Machine Learning Workshop was held on September 21-22 at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (special thanks should be dedicated to my former internship mentor <a href="https://marcocuturi.net/" style="color:#3A01DF">Marco Cuturi</a> in Japan, who has joined ENSAE and Google Brain since then). This is the first workshop that gathers leading researchers from both countries working in machine learning and affiliated fields such as statistics, applied maths and optimization. The full programme can be found on this [site](http://fjml.marcocuturi.net/).
