The France-Japan Machine Learning Workshop was held on September 21-22 at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (special thanks should be dedicated to my former internship mentor <a href="https://marcocuturi.net/" style="color:#3A01DF">Marco Cuturi</a> in Japan, who has joined ENSAE and Google Brain since then). This is the first workshop that gathers leading researchers from both countries working in machine learning and affiliated fields such as statistics, applied maths and optimization. The full programme can be found on this [site](http://fjml.marcocuturi.net/).
